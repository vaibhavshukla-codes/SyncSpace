<------------------------------------SyncSpace â€” for seamless communication----------------------------------------->
#Sockets:-
->A socket is one end of connection.
->end point: IP address + Port Number 

#Protocals:-
->communication rules
1: TCP(Transmission Control Protocal(Connection based Protocal)): Reliable but Slower
2: UDP(User Datagram Protocal(Connection less Protocal)): Faster but not Reliable

#WebRTC for Video Communication:-
->Web Real Time Communication
-> It is establishes a bidirectional connection b/w two or more devices.
-> It is a bidirection Protocal means data can flow in both direction.
-> It is used for transferring audio,video,chat.

->WebRTC is already availabe in the browser(like chrome) in the form of APIs.
-WebRTC APIs:
1: Media Stream
2: RTCPeerConnection
3: RTCDataChannel

-> How does it works ?
1: Signalling
2: Connecting
3: Securing
4: Communicating

Note: Without WebRTC: We can make a server between two devices which will perform video conferencing.
