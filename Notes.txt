<------------------------------------SyncSpace — for seamless communication----------------------------------------->
#Sockets:-
->A communication endpoint between two programs on different computers.
->A socket is one end of connection.
->End point(Socket Address) = IP address + Port Number 

#Protocals:-
->communication rules
1: TCP(Transmission Control Protocal(Connection based Protocal)): Reliable but Slower
2: UDP(User Datagram Protocal(Connection less Protocal)): Faster but not Reliable

#WebRTC for Video Communication:-(based on TCP/UDP Protocal)
->Web Real Time Communication
-> It is establishes a bidirectional connection b/w two or more devices.
-> It is a bidirection Protocal means data can flow in both direction.
-> It is used for transferring audio,video,chat.

->WebRTC is already availabe in the browser(like chrome) in the form of APIs.
-WebRTC APIs:
1: Media Stream
2: RTCPeerConnection
3: RTCDataChannel

-> How does it works ?
1: Signalling
2: Connecting
3: Securing
4: Communicating

Note: Without WebRTC: We can make a server between two devices which will perform video conferencing.


🚀 WebRTC Kya Hota Hai? (Hinglish Explanation)
WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) ek technology hai jo browser ke andar hi live audio, video aur data sharing allow karti hai — bina kisi extra app, plugin, ya software ke.

Matlab:
➡️ Browser → Browser
➡️ Live video call / audio call / screen share
➡️ Directly, fast aur secure

🎯 Simple Definition (Hinglish)
WebRTC ek aisi technology hai jo do devices ko directly connect karke unke beech real-time communication karne deti hai — jaise video calling, voice calling, file sharing, etc.


<-------------------------WebRTC Architectures------------------->
1: P2P (Peer To Peer)
2: SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)
3: MCU (Multi Point Control Unit)

1: P2P:(1:1 calls)
->In P2P Architecture each computer will be connected to other computers of P2P connection.
->We use P2P Architecture when there are less number of computers are connected each other using P2P connection.
->In P2P Architecture a single node(computer) can get multiple request so at that time computer might not be sufficient
  to handle it therefore we use other Architectures.
-> n(nodes) uploads and n(nodes) downloads.

2: SFU:(Group calls)
->In SFU each node(computer) will send it's data to the central server and that server will send the data of other nodes to each node.
->Server holds upload load and client holds download load.
->1 upload and n(nodes) download.

Inshort: Single upload and multiple downloads.(for each node)

3: MCU:(Large conferences)
->Each node(computer) sends data to the server and server collects each node data and combine it then returns combined single stream   (data) to each node.
-> Server holds maximum load.
-> 1 upload and 1 download.

Inshort: Single upload and single download.(for each node)
